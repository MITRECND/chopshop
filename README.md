Protocol Analysis/Decoder Framework

Description
===========
ChopShop is a MITRE developed framework to aid analysts in the creation and
execution of pynids based decoders and detectors of APT tradecraft.

Note that ChopShop is still in beta and is dependent on libnids/pynids for the
majority of its underlying functionality.

Documentation has been moved to the docs folder. Please reference that folder for information such as:

Embedding Chopshop


Note: There is a known issue when running ChopShop on Ubuntu where the version
of pynids obtained via apt causes an ImportError.  Per
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-nids/+bug/795991, this issue
affects some variants of at least 11.10 and 12.04.  A workaround is to
compile pynids from source which can be obtained from
http://jon.oberheide.org/pynids/.
