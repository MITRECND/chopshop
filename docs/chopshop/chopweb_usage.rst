Using chopweb
=============

The chopweb program consists of a python script that is run on the
command line that starts a web server. It requires Python 2.6+,
mod\_pywebsocket, and pynids to be installed. It, like chopshop, also
requires 'modules' to be created to do any processing of network data.

The chopweb program is currently in an alpha state and this
documentation will be updated shortly
