Decoder for Poison Ivy versions 2.3.0 and 2.3.2. This module checks the beginning of each TCP session for possible Poison Ivy challenge-response sequences. If found, it will try to validate the response using the password(s) supplied as an argument. If no password is supplied, it tries the default password “admin”.  A single password can be supplied in either plain text or hex-ascii form, or a text file containing line-delimited passwords can be supplied. If the proper password is found, the decoder goes to work on the packets. In order to use our decoder, you must install CamCrypt , a python wrapper for an open source implementation of the Camellia encryption library. Most of the features of Poison Ivy are covered to some extent. 

•	Files transferred to or from the “server” will be saved to disk when the “-f” option is used.
•	Webcam, audio, keylog, and single screen captures will be saved to disk when the “-c” option is used. The audio captures are saved as raw data which can easily be converted to wav files using a tool like “sox”. The decoder will print the sample rate, channel, and bit data.
•	File and registry search details and results are printed.
•	The details of any network relays instantiated are printed.

File, registry, service, process, device and installed application listings are partially supported. The default output will highlight that listing requests have occurred and when applicable will highlight which key/directory is being listed. Directory listings will be printed but without file details. When the module is invoked with the “-l” option, all returned list data will be saved to file raw as it is seen by the Poison Ivy client, a mixture of strings and binary data describing those strings. Running the “strings” tool or a hex editor on these dumps is useful if you are interested in the details of what was listed.

If there is an unrecognized command, or if you would like to extend the functionality of this decoder, the “-d” option is quite useful. It will print hex dumps of all the headers and assembled streams for both directions, making it easy to analyze and build more parsing functionality.

Thanks to Frank Poz for his work on the CamCrypt library that is utilized in this module.
